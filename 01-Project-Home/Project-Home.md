**Next Milestone:** Complete user‑story mapping by Feb 20  
**Last Updated:** 2026‑02‑13

## Core Problem
Building managers juggle paper tickets, missed inspections, and poor communication with tenants and vendors. Tenants suffer from slow response times and lack of visibility.

## Solution Outline
1. **Digital Issue Reporting** – photo + location + priority
2. **Maintenance Calendar** – scheduled tasks, vendor coordination
3. **Digital Logbook** – repair history, cost tracking, warranty alerts
4. **Dashboard & Analytics** – open/closed issues, compliance status, cost projections

## Stakeholders
- **Tenants** – report issues, receive updates
- **Building Managers** – prioritize, assign, track
- **Maintenance Staff/Vendors** – receive work orders, update status
- **Owners/Investors** – portfolio‑wide analytics

## Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in average repair resolution time
- 80% tenant satisfaction score
- 100% scheduled maintenance compliance
- 30% decrease in emergency repairs via preventive planning
