# Current Workflow Mapping (As-Is Process) - S1‑11

## Purpose
Document the current end-to-end maintenance request process to identify pain points, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement.

## Methodology
1. **Process Observation** - Shadow actual maintenance requests if possible
2. **Stakeholder Interviews** - Talk to each person in the process chain
3. **Artifact Collection** - Gather forms, templates, tools currently used
4. **Process Mapping** - Create visual workflow diagrams

## Key Process Stages to Map

### Stage 1: Issue Discovery & Reporting
**Actors:** Tenant, Building Staff (if issue discovered during inspection)
**Activities:**
- Tenant notices issue
- Tenant decides how/when to report
- Tenant communicates issue to management
- Management receives and logs issue

**Questions to Answer:**
- What triggers issue reporting?
- What information is captured initially?
- How is urgency determined?
- What communication channels are used?

### Stage 2: Triage & Prioritization
**Actors:** Building Manager, Assistant Manager
**Activities:**
- Review incoming issue
- Determine urgency/priority
- Categorize issue type
- Check for similar/recurring issues
- Decide on response approach

**Questions to Answer:**
- What criteria determine priority?
- Who makes prioritization decisions?
- How are emergencies handled differently?
- What information is needed for triage?

### Stage 3: Assignment & Scheduling
**Actors:** Building Manager, Maintenance Staff
**Activities:**
- Assign to appropriate staff/contractor
- Schedule date/time for repair
