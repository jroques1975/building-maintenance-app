# UI Source of Truth

## Canonical Prototype
- Primary URL: `http://100.78.107.25:8088/prototype-clean.html`
- Manager dashboard reference: `http://100.78.107.25:8088/manager-dashboard/manager-dashboard.html`
- Added: 2026-02-21
- Owner: Javier / Orion

## Rule
If implementation and memory conflict, this prototype is the visual reference.

## Implementation Order
1. Login
2. Dashboard
3. Issues
4. Work Orders
5. Operator Continuity

## Notes
- Preserve role-based behavior from backend policies.
- Build production-quality UI matching the prototype visual structure.
- Avoid fallback UAT-shell layouts for final app pages.
